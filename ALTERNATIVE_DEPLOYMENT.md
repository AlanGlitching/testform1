## 🔧 Option 4: Fix Railway (Current Issue)

The Railway deployment might be failing due to:
- Node.js version issues
- Port configuration
- Environment variables

### Try these fixes:
1. **Check Railway logs** in the dashboard
2. **Set environment variables** in Railway:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=3001`
3. **Check the deployment logs** for specific errors

For now, you can test multiplayer locally:
